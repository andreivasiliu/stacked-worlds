Ideas:
* Objects, inventory, manipulation
  * Objects collide with ground and nothing else
* Colored background for each room
  * Make an initial seeded random based on the entity
  * Just draw it normally, upgrade DrawRoom to use Rectangle
* Background/foreground layers
  * Ability to switch layer being drawn upon
